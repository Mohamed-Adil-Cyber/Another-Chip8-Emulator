# Another-Chip8-Emulator
Started developing this script to test emu dev and there is no emulator easier and more developed than chip 8 emulator with only 36 opcodes.

The program takes the rom file creates a background with pygame, creates a program counter and starts at the entry point of 0x200 going through the opcodes 1 by 1.
